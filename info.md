'New_gesture' is a model which does not used the label studio dataet. 
The older "gesture" file contained a program that used JSON format dataset.
New one will use mediapipe and mobilnet, but without the LabelStudio dataset. 
Instead, we are using: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datamunge/sign-language-mnist
